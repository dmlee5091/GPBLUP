# GPBLUP: Genomic Prediction using Genomic and Pedigree Information

**Version 1.0 | February 15, 2026 | Technical Manual with Mathematical Formulations**

## 1. Program Overview

GPBLUP (Genomic Prediction using Breeding values with SNP and Polygenic effects) is a statistical package program developed as a modular unit to estimate breeding values (EBV) of animals by utilizing genomic information (SNP data) and pedigree information (genealogical data).

### 1.1 Development Purpose

This program is developed with the purpose of estimating animal breeding values by including both of the following effects using genomic information and pedigree information:

- **SNP Gene Effects**: Direct impacts of individual SNP markers on the phenotype
- **Polygenic Effects**: Multi-gene hereditary effects that are not explained by SNP markers

Through these capabilities, it enables more accurate genetic evaluation and efficient operation of breeding programs.

### 1.2 Development Environment

- **Programming Language**: Fortran 90/95
- **Build System**: CMake 3.10+
- **Compiler**: GNU Fortran (gfortran) 11.4.0 or later
- **Operating System**: Linux/Unix-based systems

### 1.3 Development Plan and Future Expansion

The program is designed to be implementable on **various platforms using GPU acceleration**:

- NVIDIA GPU (CUDA) support planned
- Multi-core CPU parallel processing support
- Cloud environment compatibility

Additional modules under development will be continuously updated.

## 2. Key Features

### 2.1 ReadFR (FinalReport Reader)

Reads Illumina SNP FinalReport format files and performs the following functions:

#### Main Characteristics:
- **Large-scale Data Processing**: Processes hundreds of thousands of SNPs x thousands of animal data
- **SNP Quality Control (QC)**: Automatic filtering based on statistical criteria
- **Multiple Input Format Support**: Supports TAB and SPACE delimiters
- **Case-Insensitive**: Allows mixed case usage in parameter files

#### SNP Quality Control Criteria:
Default filtering criteria (customizable):

```
- GC Score >= 0.65          : Genotype reliability filter
- R (Intensity) 0.40 - 2.00 : Signal intensity range filter
- GT Score >= 0.50          : Genotype quality score
- Cluster Separation >= 0.30 : Cluster separation measure
- Animal Call Rate >= 0.70   : Animal-wise call rate
```

#### Mathematical Formulations for QC Metrics:

**GC Score (Genotype Confidence):**
$$GC = 1 - \sqrt{\frac{d_{min}^2}{d_{min}^2 + d_{mean}^2}}$$

where:
- $d_{min}$ = minimum distance to genotype cluster center
- $d_{mean}$ = mean distance to all clusters

Interpretation: GC >= 0.65 ensures genotype accuracy > 99%

**R (Intensity):** Log_1_0(Intensity) ratio between channels
$$R = \log_{10}\left(\frac{I_x + I_y}{0.5}\right)$$

Range 0.4-2.0 indicates valid signal intensity; values outside suggest failed genotyping

**GT Score (Genotype Quality):**
Phred-scale quality score normalized to [0,1] space
- GT >= 0.50: High confidence
- GT < 0.50: May indicate ambiguous clustering or signal failure

**Cluster Separation:**
$$ClusterSep = \frac{d_{between}}{d_{within}}$$

where:
- $d_{between}$ = mean distance between cluster centers
- $d_{within}$ = mean distance within clusters

Threshold >= 0.30 ensures sufficient cluster resolution

**Call Rate (Animal-wise):**
$$CallRate = \frac{N_{called}}{N_{total}}$$

where:
- $N_{called}$ = number of successfully genotyped SNPs
- $N_{total}$ = total number of SNPs on array

Minimum 70% call rate prevents statistical unreliability from excessive missing data

**QC Impact on Prediction Accuracy:**
$$AccuracyReduction = 0.02 \times (1 - CallRate)$$

For example, 80% call rate reduces accuracy by ~4%

### 2.2 Genomic Calculations and Prediction Formulations

#### 2.2.1 Mixed Model Equation

The underlying statistical model utilized in GPBLUP:

$$y = X\beta + Z_u u_{SNP} + Z_p a_{poly} + e$$

where:
- $y$ = vector of phenotypic observations
- $X$ = design matrix for fixed effects
- $\beta$ = vector of fixed effects (e.g., herd, sex, age)
- $Z_u$ = design matrix for SNP effects
- $u_{SNP}$ = vector of SNP-derived genomic effects
- $Z_p$ = design matrix for polygenic effects
- $a_{poly}$ = vector of polygenic effects (residual additive effects)
- $e$ = vector of residual errors

**Variance Structure:**
$$\text{Var}(u_{SNP}) = G \sigma_u^2, \quad \text{Var}(a_{poly}) = A \sigma_a^2, \quad \text{Var}(e) = I\sigma_e^2$$

where:
- $G$ = genomic relationship matrix (from SNP data)
- $A$ = pedigree additive relationship matrix
- $\sigma_u^2$ = SNP effect variance
- $\sigma_a^2$ = polygenic effect variance
- $\sigma_e^2$ = residual error variance

#### 2.2.2 Genomic Relationship Matrix (VanRaden Method)

**Calculation:**
$$G_{ij} = \frac{\sum_k (x_{ik} - 2p_k)(x_{jk} - 2p_k)}{2\sum_k p_k(1-p_k)}$$

where:
- $x_{ik}$ = genotype at locus $k$ for individuals $i$ ($\in \{0,1,2\}$)
- $p_k$ = allele frequency at locus $k$
- The denominator represents the maximum genetic variance possible

**Interpretation:**
- $G_{ij} = 1$: Individuals are genetically identical (duplicates)
- $G_{ij} = 0.5$: First-degree relatives (parent-offspring or full siblings)
- $G_{ij} = 0.25$: Second-degree relatives (grandparent-grandchild)
- $G_{ij} < 0$: Unrelated or distantly related individuals

#### 2.2.3 Prediction Accuracy

**Theoretical accuracy formula:**
$$r = \sqrt{\frac{N_e \times h^2}{2N_e + \sigma_e^2/\sigma_a^2}}$$

where:
- $N_e$ = effective number of reference animals
- $h^2$ = heritability of the trait
- $\sigma_e^2/\sigma_a^2$ = ratio of environmental to additive genetic variance

**Accuracy improvements with different information sources:**

| Information Type | Typical Accuracy |
|---|---|
| Phenotype only (n=5 daughters) | 0.30-0.40 |
| + Pedigree information | 0.40-0.50 |
| + 50K SNPs (large dataset) | 0.70-0.80 |
| + HD SNPs (1M markers) | 0.80-0.90 |

#### 2.2.4 Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) Impact

Number of effectively independent SNP segments:

$$M_e = N_{SNP} \times \prod \sqrt{r^2_{adj}}$$

Where high LD regions contribute fractional information. This affects:
- Information per SNP: Higher LD -> fewer independent markers needed
- Across-population accuracy: Lower LD among founder populations reduces prediction accuracy in descendants

#### 2.2.5 Estimated Breeding Values (EBV) Calculation

**BLUP (Best Linear Unbiased Prediction):**
$$\hat{u} = (Z'R^{-1}Z + G^{-1}\lambda)^{-1}Z'R^{-1}y$$

where:
- $R$ = residual covariance matrix
- $\lambda$ = ratio of residual to genetic variance
- Solution vector $\hat{u}$ includes both SNP and polygenic effects

**Equivalent reliability formula:**
$$Rel = \frac{\sigma_{a_{est}}^2}{\sigma_a^2} = 1 - \frac{\sigma_e^2(Z'Z + \lambda G^{-1})^{-1}_{ii}}{\sigma_a^2}$$

Higher reliability indicates more precise EBV estimation
